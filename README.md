# We Rate Dogs Report

The project is a simple analysis of tweets from a Twitter account names "We Rate Dogs." 

The real focus in this project was actually fetching the data from Twitter, whcih involved requesting developer access and
getting familiar with the Tweepy API. This was definitely a challenging one, but manageable.

All the data, the notebook and html files are uploaded incase you'd like to follow along or get creative with it.
